ATTRIBUTES -- UNIT TESTING  --  TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT -- DESIGN PATTERNS: COMPOSITE 


ATTRIBUTES: "An attribute is a declarative tag that is used to convey information to runtime about the behaviours of various elements like classes, methods, structures, enumerators, assemblies in your program"
	- "Attributes are used for adding metadata, such as compiler instruction and other information such as comments, description, methods and classes to a program"


UNIT TESTING 
	- A method to insure that smal units of src code are of proper quality
	- A common feature of Agile Software Development 
	- A "unit" is often a class/interface, but can also just be a method
	- Typically, each test case is written independently to test small units of code  
	-Advantages: 
		- Confirm each components functionality 
		- Find bugs easly (cheaper)
		- Smootens the process of integrating code units
		- Can be used as documentation of code 

	- Disadvantages: 
		- Costly 
		- Tests have to be updated 
		- Tests can also contain bugs 
		- Is only one type of testing, one needs several more 
	- NUnit: Framework for C#, just like JUnit for Java
