SOLID - Guidelines and patterns 

	- Single- responsability 
		- Write Code that has one and only one reason to change
		- If a class has more than one reason to change, it has more than one resp 
	
	-  OPEN CLOSED PRINCIPE
		- Adapt the modules  
				- Virtuelle 
				- Abstrakte 
				- Interface 
	
	- The Liskov Substitution Principle 
		- Contract Rules 
			- Preconditions can not be strengthen in the sub-time	
				- IF-ELSE: If an impl tries to change to a state that the super does not have then the prog can fail
			- Post can not be weakend in sub
			- Invariants of the supertype - object state can not be changed 
			-
