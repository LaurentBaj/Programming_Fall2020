RECURSION

	Function that calls upon itself
	Needs a stop criterion
	For a large input
		- there would be to many frames made (stack overflow)
	
	Two different recursion strategies
		- second one is better (check ppt)
			- Dividing the array into two pieces and making two rec-calls
	
	Usually, loops are better 
	Some algorithms are more effective with Recursion like Merge and Quick sort 

MERGE SORT
	Divide and conquer
		- Compare the arrays
	Needs a stopping criteria 
		- sortet when size of array is one 
	N Log N tight-bound - both best and worst case 
	Not particulary fast and has some drawback when it comes to memory 
	
QUICK SORT 
	One of the most used
	Better constant compared to merge sort  
	Minimal memory overhead 
	N log N 


TDD 
	Design methology 
	 -create tests that fail at first then implement 
	Little evidence that it works, small decrease in productivity
