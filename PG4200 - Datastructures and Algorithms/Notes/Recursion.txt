RECURSION 

When a method calls itself it is known as a recursive method

Used in some algorithms such as Merge and Quick
	- We often write algorithms iteratively, but recursion CAN be used much more effectivly 

Effective when the input does not require as many recursive calls

Needs a base case/breaking point lest it will perform infinite calls and create a stack overflow issue
