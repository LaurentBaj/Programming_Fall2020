HASTABLES - MAPS - DICTIONARIES

Hastable is an abstract datatype 

Provide access to data using Keys: Key value pairs 

Adding item: Provide Key and Value 
Retreive item: Provide Key 

HASHTABLES are optimized for retreiving data when we know the key 

KEY DOES NOT HAVE TO BE AN INTEGER 
	- All keys are converted to Integers (HASHING)
	- Hash function maps keys to int 
	- Every Object in Java inherits a Hashcode method 
	- Collisoin: hashing method may produce the same int for a key 

LOAD FACTOR 
	- How full the hash table is 
	- Load Factor = amount of things in ds % hashtable.size
		- Used to decide whn to rezize 
		- A small LF means that the datastructure is ineffective
		- A big LF increases the chances of collision 


ADD TO HASH TABLE BACKED BY AN ARRAY 
1) Provide  a key/value pair 
2) Use a hash function to hash the key to an int value 
3) Retrieve the value stored at the hashed key value
