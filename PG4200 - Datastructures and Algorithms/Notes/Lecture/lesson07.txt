ITERATORS - LAMBDAS - STREAMS 


Easy to iterate over arrays- not as easy on other DSs 


A colletion can implement Iterable Interface
	- Allows for for(X x: Collection)
	- Collection should not be altered while iterating over them 

Lambdas - Syntactic sugar 
	- Effective ways of implementing Interfaces by using anonymous classes
